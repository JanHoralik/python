Me, net and team mates
     I play volleyball once a week and I love it because  I have always  loved sports and ballgames, especially dutchball .Vollyball is a game where you have  justa  ball, team mates  and  fun. 
I took up volly in first grade in junor high school. I was twelve and I was really short so I had problems playing by the net. At the begining we were changing our place  every game but  I was much more  better in the middle and the back of the playground. Now  because of my height I play in the middle of the playground and I am one of the best players in my school team.
